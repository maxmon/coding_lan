##format

~% new line

~& new line ,unless already new line

	> (format t "Fruit flies~%~%like bananas.")
	Fruit flies
	
	like bananas.
	NIL

~S

	(defun square-talk (n)
	(format t "~&~S squared is ~S" n (* n n)))
	> (square-talk 10)
	10 squared is 100
	NIL

~A

	(defun test (x)
	(format t "~&With escape characters: ~S" x)
	(format t "~&Without escape characters: ~A" x))
	> (test "Hi, mom")
	With escape characters: "Hi, mom"
	Without escape characters: Hi, mom
	NIL

~D

~F

###PARAMETERS TO FORMAT DIRECTIVES

the ~S directive accepts a width parameter

##read

 The object
does not have to be quoted becauseit will not be evaluated

	(defun my-square ()
	(format t "Please type in a number: ")
	(let ((x (read)))
	(format t "The number ~S squared is ~S.~%"
	x (* x x))))

##YES-OR-NO-P  Y-OR-N-P

	(defun riddle ()
	(if (yes-or-no-p
	"Do you seek Zen enlightenment? ")
	(format t "Then do not ask for it!")
	(format t "You have found it.")))

##READING FILES WITH WITH-OPEN-FILE

`(WITH-OPEN-FILE (var pathname)
body)`

WITH-OPEN-FILE creates a local variable (just like LET) and setsit to a
stream object representing a connection to that file.

Streamobjects are a
special Lisp datatype fordescribing connections to files

Onleaving the WITH-OPEN-FILE form,the connection to the file
is closed automatically


Let’s try an example ofreading data from a file. Suppose the file
‘‘timber.dat’’ in the directory /usr/dst contains these lines:

	"The North Slope"
	((45 redwood) (12 oak) (43 maple))
	100

We can read this data with the following program:


	(defun get-tree-data ()
	(with-open-file (stream "/usr/dst/timber.dat")
	(let* ((tree-loc (read stream))
	(tree-table (read stream))
	(num-trees (read stream)))
	(format t "~&There are ~S trees on ~S."
	num-trees tree-loc)
	(format t "~&They are: ~S" tree-table))))

##WRITING FILES WITH WITH-OPEN-FILE

	(defun save-tree-data (tree-loc tree-table
	num-trees)
	(with-open-file (stream "/usr/dst/timber.newdat"
	:direction :output)
	(format stream "~S~%" tree-loc)
	(format stream "~S~%" tree-table)
	(format stream "~S~%" num-trees)))

##Lisp Toolkit: DRIBBLE

The DRIBBLE functionrecords part of a Lisp session in a file

## HANDLING END-OF-FILE CONDITIONS

program gets to theend of the file, the next
READ will generate an end-of-file error, and you’llend up in the debugger.
It is possible to tell READto return a special value, called an eof indicator,
instead of generating an error on end of file

 a good choice for an eof indicator is a freshly
generated cons cell

use EQ rather than EQUAL to make sure that
exactly that cons cell is returned

	
	(defun read-my-file ()
	(with-open-file (stream "/usr/dst/sample-file")
	(let ((contents
	(read-all-objects stream (list ’$eof$))))
	(format t "~&Read ~S objects from the file."
	(length contents))
	contents)))
	(defun read-all-objects (stream eof-indicator)
	(let ((result (read stream nil eof-indicator)))
	(if (eq result eof-indicator)
	nil
	(cons result (read-all-objects stream)))))
